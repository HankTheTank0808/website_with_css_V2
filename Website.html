    <h2>Government</h2> 
      <p>The government of Lebanon is a strong confessionalism. To explain you must know that Lebanon has had civil wars between themselves because of peopleâ€™s religion. So, in order to prevent such civil war the Lebanon government splits power of the leaders to the weight of the religion. But they also raise other problems. Since the country is still mostly Islam then the Islamic majority has more power over the country. </p>
